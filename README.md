# Stably Cash: The Next-Gen Partial-Collateralized Algorithmic Stablecoin

A new category of decentralized stablecoin with a novel mechanism.

------

Stably Cash is one of the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocols. Stably Cash is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain – currently implemented on Ethereum (with possible cross chain implementations in the future). The end goal of the Stably Cash protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC. 

Stably Cash is a new paradigm in stablecoin design. It brings together familiar concepts into a never before seen protocol:

**Fractional-Algorithmic** – Stably Cash is the first and only stablecoin with parts of its supply backed by collateral and parts of the supply algorithmic. The ratio of collateralized and algorithmic depends on the market's pricing of the STC stablecoin. If STC is trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If STC is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio. 

**Decentralized & Governance**-minimized – Community governed and emphasizing a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management. 

**Fully on-chain oracles** – Stably Cash v1 uses Uniswap (ETH, USDT, USDC time-weighted average prices) and Chainlink (USD price) oracles. 

**Two Tokens** – STC is the stablecoin targeting a tight band around $1/coin. Stably Shares (STS) is the governance token which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value.

**Swap-based Monetary Policy** – Stably Cash uses principles from automated market makers like Uniswap to create swap-based price discovery and real-time stabilization incentives through arbitrage.
